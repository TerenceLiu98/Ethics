				- Nelson Mandela 
		* philosophy and religion questions:
			* Why are we here?
			*  What is the meaning of life? 
			* How should we treat one another?	
	
	* Ethic, Religion, and Divine Command Theory
		* Do we need religion to dis cuss ethics?
			- Author says no; use reasoning instead ( Do not need religion to   discuss ethics
		* Divine Command Theory
			* The idea is that certain actions are right because they are what God wills for us ( wants us to do )
			* E.g. the 10 Commandments
			* In Plato’s *Euthyphro* ( A book ), Socrates asked, 
				* Are things good because they are approved by gods?
					* ::if so, better fin out what God told us to do::
				* Or are things approved by gods because they are good?
					* ::If so, don’t have to find out what God told us::
				
	* Both religious and atheist should develop moral reasoning skills, because: 
		* We should critically ( using reasons ) evaluate our own or other views of good and bad.
		* Believers and nonbelievers ought to be able to discuss moral matters together.
		* We live in a secular society. We need to come up with a common view of justice and fairness, so we can develop good laws.
	
	* Pluralism and the Golden Rule 
	*There are so many religions in the world; which one to follow regarding ethics?*
		* `己所不欲，勿施于人` is the Golden Rule
	
	* The Problem of Evil and Free Will
		* Problem of Evil 
			* Why are there evil and suffering in this world?
				* ::Buddhist::: Suffering comes from attachment to the fleeting things of this world.
				* Theodicies( Greek for “God justify”)
				* Some Christian philosophers’ view to explain why evil exists even though there is a benevolent and all powerful God
				* Original Sin; humans  have a propensity ( ability and tendency ) to sin ( Augustine )
				* Humans have Free Will to choose between good and evil ( Leibniz )
				* ::Christian philosophers::’ view to explain why evil exists even though there is a benevolent and all powerful God
				* Book says,”Some philosophers deny that there is free will in any entirely deterministic universe. Others argued that free will remains compatible with determinism.”

## Chapter 3 Ethical Relativism
	* **Subjective**: Based on opinion from one’s point-of-view;
	* **Objective**: Based on “honest”assessment, not just from my point-of-view;
	* **Reason for Ethical Relativism**
		* So many people and cultures have different ideas on what is ethical
		* How do we decide what is good and evil?
		* “It all depends on people’s point-of-view or opinion”
	* **Results of Ethical Relativism**
		* No one’s opinion is better than another’s
		* No objective standards to judge others
	
	::Descriptive(use statistics)and Normative(Norm)::

### (A)Descriptive Ethical Relativism
		* Descriptive (or factual)claim that there are different ideas about ethical values
		* “It’s a fact”; we can describe and list how the different cultures and people have different ideas about what is right or wrong.
		* Textbook lists many examples in this section
		* “When in Rome, do as the Romans do.”
### (B)Metaethical(or Normative) Relativism
		* Says there are no universal or objective norms
		* All values are based on believes, opinions and practices of individuals or cultures
###  (C)Objectivism(Non-relativism)
		* There are universal norms 
		* Natural Science(including Statistics) is generally objective
			* If you get a wrong answer in a test, you won’t be able to convince the teacher that’s just his opinion
	

Between Relativism there are some difference 
	::Individual relativism::
			* Ethical judgements and beliefs are the expression of moral outlook and attitudes of individual persons(book’s definition)
	::Cultural relativism::
			* The basis for moral judgements lies inch cultural view
					* Ethical values change from culture to culture 
					* No one culture’s value is better than another
					* Individuals must consider the value of the culture they are in.
